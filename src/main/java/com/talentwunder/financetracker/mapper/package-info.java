/**
 * This package contains the interfaces that are responsible for mapping data.
 * Mapping is done from model class to dto class and other way around.
 * Each mapper in this package corresponds to a single object and is named after that object, followed by
 * the word "Mapper". For example, the TransactionMapper interface maps data between the Transaction domain
 * object and the database table that stores working position information.
